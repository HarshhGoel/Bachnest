## üéØ Problem Statement

Relocating to a new city, especially for students and young professionals, is a fragmented and stressful process. Newcomers face significant challenges:
* **Finding Housing:** Navigating high brokerage fees, unverified listings, and a lack of transparency.
* **Essential Setup:** The high upfront cost and logistical hassle of purchasing or sourcing essential appliances.
* **Daily Services:** Identifying trustworthy and reliable local help like cooks, cleaners, and tiffin services without local contacts.

This creates a significant barrier to settling in comfortably and quickly.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

Dwello addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, transparent, and trust-based ecosystem. This landing page is the first point of contact, designed to communicate our commitment to:

* **Convenience:** A single platform for housing, rentals, and local services.
* **Trust:** Physically verified listings and community-rated service providers.
* **Affordability:** A lowest brokerage guarantee and cost-effective rental options to reduce the financial burden on newcomers.

    * A clear, icon-driven grid explaining the pay-per-use model for essential services like cooks, Wi-Fi, cleaning, and repairs.
    * Subtle hover animations on service cards to improve user interaction.

    * An immersive, dark-themed section that animates on scroll using the **Intersection Observer API**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built with a focus on performance and simplicity, requiring no complex build tools. All assets are served via CDNs.

* **Structure & Semantics:** `HTML5`
* **Styling:**
    * **Tailwind CSS (v3 via CDN):** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent UI development.
    * **Custom CSS:** In-line `<style>` block for bespoke animations, hover effects, and a custom font implementation.
* **Interactivity & DOM Manipulation:**
    * **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6):** Used for the mobile menu toggle, dynamic search bar, and the on-scroll animation logic.
    * **Intersection Observer API:** Efficiently triggers animations for the "Bill Split" section when it enters the viewport.
* **Assets:**
    * **Font Awesome (v6 via CDN):** For a comprehensive and scalable icon set.
    * **Google Fonts:** The 'Poppins' font family is used for modern and clean typography.

## üí° Code Highlights

A few notable aspects of the implementation:

* **Efficient Animations:** The use of the `IntersectionObserver` is a modern, performance-friendly alternative to scroll-event listeners for triggering animations, preventing layout thrashing.
* **Utility-First with Customization:** The project primarily uses Tailwind's utility classes but demonstrates how to add custom styles (`card-hover`, keyframe animations) for unique design requirements without ejecting from the framework's philosophy.
* **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML tags (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) are used to improve SEO and accessibility. `aria-label` attributes are used on icon-only buttons.
